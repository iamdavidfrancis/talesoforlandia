          </p>
          <p>
            Those were the final words uttered from the treacherous mouth of Corvdius, the once supposed loyal sage to Prince Validus, only to be revealed the banished Emperor of the Yaoguai! Much time has passed and there has been much unrest in Orlandia. Many citizens of Orlandia, along with the mysterious Fae folk, have begun to form a resistance to restore freedom for all in their once glorious kingdom. The Emperor has responded by offering riches and high rank to those who would help crush the rebellion. The great battle between the Shadowfowl and the Anarchs is about to begin. Who will prevail?
