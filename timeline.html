          <p>
            Those were the final words uttered from the treacherous mouth of Corvdius, the once supposed loyal sage to Prince Validus, only to be revealed the banished Emperor of the Yaoguai! Much time has passed and there has been much unrest in Orlandia. Many citizens of Orlandia, along with the mysterious Fae folk, have begun to form a resistance to restore freedom for all in their once glorious kingdom. The Emperor has responded by offering riches and high rank to those who would help crush the rebellion. The great battle between the Shadowfowl and the Anarchs is about to begin. Who will prevail?

            New technologies have brought Orlandia to the air! Many factions compete for resources, which one will take the day?
            Now the Orlandia Sky Defense Force protect the country with their loyal pilots, aerologists, and "Air Knights". 
            The Benevolent Order of Stone Mages keeps the city in the sky. Members of this secret society are the only ones who know how to bless the floatstones. 
            Members of the Orlandia Engineering Society keep the city running smoothly. These tradesman, docksmen, miners, and laborers keep everything running, from the plumbing to the air ships.
            The League of Privateers for Free Trade and Acquisitions is marred with the reputation of being populated by pirates and thieves. These pirates have been in a longstanding conflict with the OSDF, ever since the pirates "acquired" the OSDF's prized air fortress.

            After the floating city of Orlandia came crashing down, new powers rose trying to control the city. The Order of Neo-Orlandia rules Orlandia with an iron fist. Queen Octantis upholds order in the city by any means necessary, and the Order carries out her will. In response to the cruel actions of the Order, a resistance has sprung up among Orlandia's disenfranchised and POLARIS will do whatever it takes to return the power to the people. Led by the elusive Sweet Red Vinyl, POLARIS will attempt to defeat the Order.
            Outside of the city, where the Order has less control, the Jesters have risen up with their own definition of "power". This faction does not wish to control Orlandia. With their leader, The Bandit King, they seek only to see the world burn. The Bandit King's lust for Bloodshed means that only Orlandia's complete destruction will appease him

          <p>
            Which faction will secure Orlandia? The powerful Order? The POLARIS resistance? The homicidal Jesters?

            The NuHelix corporation seeks to claim the resources the Wyldewood has to offer, with no regard for the creatures that live there. The Wyldewood Preservation Society seeks to stop them at all cost and defend these creatures. Who will succeed?
