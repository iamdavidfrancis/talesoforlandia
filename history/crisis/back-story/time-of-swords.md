Hard leather heels dug into the horse’s flank, spurring it past an already break-neck speed. A tree branch scratched across her neck. Beads of blood dripped down Farah’s throat. She flinched, looking back for the red glow of their pursuer’s hateful glare. He was gaining ground.

“Kayden! Thorne is closing!” Farah clung tighter to Kayden’s waist.

The knight growled in frustration, and yanked the reigns to the right, nearly sending their squire tumbling off the horse. The evasive maneuver did little to break Thorne’s progress. Kayden’s eyes darted back and forth, hunting for a route that would lead to an escape, or at least give them a stronger place to stand and fight.

“Duck!”

Kayden felt Farah’s hand yank down on their shoulder, dragging their head down by the horse’s neck. The motion caused the knight’s arm to pull at the reigns, turning the horse’s head at the same moment a javelin flew by. The horse let out a loud neigh as the missile cut a gash in its side. It was all Kayden could do to keep the two of them from being tossed off as their steed darted back and forth. As the horse was brought under control, they broke the tree line. Fifty yards away was the edge of a cliff. Being thrown may have been the better option.

“Cursed be that fool in kings clothes. And cursed be his lap dogs and wolves,” Kayden said. They pulled the horse up just shy of the edge, and turned about.

“Orders? Ideas?” Farah asked. Her hand went to the short sword at her hip.

“We do what all knights are called to. We fight the unjust.”

Kayden dismounted and went for the shield strapped to their horse’s flank. Thorne walked his Nightmare forward as Kayden and Farah stepped about, weapons barred. The king’s guard, in his dark armor, drew forth his sharp edged mace. A deep throated, mirthless laugh echoed from him.

“You stand as if to die with some shred of honor left. But there will be no songs or stories told of your slaughter.” Thorne brandished his mace and charged.

Shield out, Kayden rushed in, meeting the ghastly creature and the Nightmare he rode. The black hooves connected with their shield. Kayden rolled and thrust upward at Thorne’s off side. Steel met with steel. But before Thorne could counter, Farah’s own blade dove in, digging into the Nightmare’s belly. The beast reared in agony. It threw its rider to the dirt. The beast dissipated into black mist and flew towards Thorne’s belt. As it did, he stood.

Kayden shifted to stand between their squire and the king’s guard. The two anointed knights held each other’s stare for a long moment. A howling wind picked up. Leaves and dust and debris whipped past unmoving legs. As the tree line bent in- limbs craning for a better look at the coming bloodshed- Thorne rushed forward. Kayden planted their shield firmly in the dirt, unwilling to yield any further ground. Black edged steel swung in. But at the last moment, Thorne’s mace diverted, clipping the corner of Kayden’s shield harmlessly.
The two fighters paused, confused. Thorne no longer looked at his prey, but past them. Kayden knew they would have no better opportunity, and swung with all their might. The space between them felt like water, slowing the strike. And then a pull. Kayden felt not only their sword arm yanked back, but their entire body sucked back by an unrelenting gust.

The ground rushed away from Kayden. Howling wind filled their ears, then nothing. Color exploded all around, brighter and more intense than anything Kayden had ever seen. But they couldn’t take notice, as their skin erupted in searing pain, the pressure of a mountain threatening to crush them from all sides.

Then cold air, and the sound of their bodies thumping into a wooden hull.

Kayden could see nothing but the blinding colors for a long while, and fumbled at their knees, searching for anything familiar.

“Here, let me help you, my lo- I mean liege” Farah stammered, lifting Kayden from under their arm. They could breathe easy, knowing their companion was there.

Kayden started to offer their thanks when a door banged open behind them.

“Khaz'radan be damned, who’s out here banging on my ship in the middle of the night?” Charlotte Rousseau strode out, gun raised and hand at her cutlass. “If you’re with that blathering scientist and his followers, I’ve warned you once I’ll-” the captain halted abruptly, seeing the clear confusion on the pair’s face as they looked about.

“…I’m sorry,” said Kayden, standing taller. Their eyesight was slowly returning. “I’m… not sure where we are, and I can’t quite see, yet.”

“Aye, you will. Come inside,” Captain Rousseau slid her gun back in her belt and motioned to Farah to help her companion in. “What’s left of my ship is the closest thing this place has to neutral port. And hospital. And bar.”

“Is that sanitary?” Farah asked, helping Kayden inside the hull of what seemed to be a wrecked ship.

“Honestly girl, are ye?” Charlotte fired back.

A light smirk worked its way onto Kayden’s lips. Their eyes had adjusted and they could see the pirate with whom Farah and them had been conversing, “I like her.”
