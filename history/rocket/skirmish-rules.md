title: Skirmish: War Between Worlds Rules
---

In the city of Lunar Orlandia, a game from the ancient times has gotten popular among the the Cadets and Pilots of the Astro Force Orlandia.  These brave young Rocket Rangers have been enthralled by the old Orlandian game of "Skirmish: A Clash in the Skies".  A newer version of this old game has emerged, with some added tactics, that is sweeping the ranks of the Astro Academy, and here's how to play it!

## The Deal

Shuffle well and deal cards in an alternative fashion, dispensing 7 cards to each player. The remaining cards are placed in a stack face down. This becomes the **Draw Pile**. From the 7 cards they received, players then must pick and place 3 **Hull Cards** in a row face down in front of them. Once the **Hull Cards** are placed, the Dealer turns the top card of the **Draw Pile** over, placing it face up next to the **Draw Pile**. On the first turn, Player 1 will have to respond to this drawn card. The first card must be a numbered card. If the first card is a _Captain_ or an _Ace_ card, the Dealer places the card back into the middle of the deck, and draws another cards to begin the game.

## What is the Hull?

 _Skirmish! War Between Worlds_ is a fast-paced card game that captures the spirit of combat between Rocketships in the Retro Sci Fi themed Interactive Convention Experience (ICE) “Rocket Rangers of Orlandia” at [Anime Festival Orlando](https://animefestivalorlando.com).  The 3 cards played as the **Hull** represent the hull of a player’s ‘rocketship’.  When a player sustains damage, called a **Hull Breach**, he must forfeit a card, placing it atop the Discard Pile.  Hull cards are played from left to right. Once a player loses their last Hull Card, the game is over and the opponent wins.  With that in mind, it will be your goal to force your opponent to lose all of their Hull Cards, sending their compromised rocketship twisting and plummeting from the sky.

## The Cards

**Suit Cards 2-7**: These cards are their face value and have no significant powers.

**Captain Cards**: These cards are used to initiate and attack or to block an attack by an opponent who used a *Captain Card*

**Ace Cards**: These cards can be played to counter and attack from a *Captain Card* and reverses the damage, sending it back to the attacker. It can also be used as a **Sniper Attack** to attack an opponent with unpreventable damage.

**Tactics Cards**: These cards modify how your game is played. Each player will have a variety of collectible **Tactics Cards** in their **Tactics Deck**. These cards are kept separate from the regular play deck and are denoted with a different card back. At the beginning of a game, each player chooses 3 **Tactics Cards** from their **Tactics Deck** to use for the game.

The player then gains the extra power from these Tactics card for the duration of the round, or until the **Tactics Card** is destroyed or discarded by another **Tactics Card**. If that happens, put the destroyed **Tactics Card** at the bottom of the **Tactics Deck**, and turn over the top card of your **Tactics Deck**.  This becomes your new **Tactics Card** until it is destroyed and a new card is revealed.
