Jasper and Shana sneak into an abandoned bunker looking for Porphyrion’s machine. They are caught almost immediately, since Eureka and Porphyrion knew that since Shana joined the Resistance she would try to lead Jasper to the last known location of the machine. Jasper begs Porphyrion to explain why they are doing what they are doing. 

Porphyrion explains that they want to rule all of Orlandia. They explain that a man named Patroculus invents what would one day become a time machine. A man named Tempus built that time machine and began ripping apart time to try and meet Patroculus but was killed. An agent of the Withered Hand named Armaros was able to recover the time machine, but because of the damage to the timeline Tempus caused, the Withered Hand couldn’t seem to take over. They were all over the timeline in various forms, but couldn’t seem to stay. That’s when Porphyrion decided to build their machine to reset the universe.

Porphyrion goes on to explain, at Jasper’s confusion, that the Withered Hand has been behind many of the major events in Orlandia’s timeline. One event being pulling the floating city of Orlandia out of the sky. The revelation comes as a shock not just to Jasper, but to Eureka as well, who are both from the floating city at different points in time. Eureka asks Porphyrion why they would destroy her city, which enrages Porphyrion who believes the city to be theirs and claims they destroyed it because NuHelix had gotten to powerful in their time.

Eureka decides to help the Resitance and goes to lead them to where the machine is. That is when Porphyrion explains that they had already had the machine moved elsewhere without Eureka’s knowledge. Porphyrion leaves to attend to other matters, and Shana confronts Eureka thinking that this is all some elaborate trick. Eureka explains that she knows how to reprogram the machine, and with time ticking down, Jasper accepts her into the Resistance.
