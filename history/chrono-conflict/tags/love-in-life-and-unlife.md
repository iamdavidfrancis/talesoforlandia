## The Tale of Hana

There is a tale of a spirit wracked by sorrows desperately searching for peace, a search began even while she was among the living.

Along the Lirasen River once lay a village so small that its only name was that of the river. Everyone had their tasks, and lived in harmony for their simple existence. While everyone was vital, perhaps the most honorable title besides the Shrine Keepers was that of Protector. Nine Protectors did the village have, in bands of three. Their days were divided into thirds – hours for guarding, hours for hunting, and hours for rest.

The closest band was that of Hana the Hunter, Shiro the Songweaver, and Basho the Blade. Steadfast Hana was the center of the three, as she was Shiro’s twin and Basho’s lover.

Their love and loyalty ran deep, and it may have been this closeness that destroyed the village.

Shiro was a fine Protector – but a curious young man, as bards often are. While out hunting one day, he found a strange amulet in the ruins of an old shrine, unearthed by recent floods. He took the amulet. Hana knew, but said nothing. She saw no harm in the act, and would protect her brother with her dying breath.

Unfortunate events began to take place just the following day. The river turned dark and fish were drawn from it already dead. Heavy rain buffeted the area, with no sun shining for several days straight and floods retaking the land.

Shiro shared knowledge of the amulet with Hana and Basho then, and all three feared it was to blame. When they next hunted, they tried to return it, but could not find the shrine.

When they returned without prey, they returned to an angry mob. A Diviner had received signs that they were to blame for the misfortunes. The punishment was to be death for the one who took the amulet and banishment for the two who kept secrets.

Hana stepped forward, determined to protect her brother. However, Basho was faster and had sneaked the amulet from Shiro’s pocket. Not wanting the twins to be separated, he insisted it was his fault and was killed where he stood.

Grief tore from Hana’s throat in a wail, but Shiro pulled her away. He had to use his songweaving powers to play Hana into slumber, for she was too much torn between anger at Basho’s death, fear for their villagers, and grief over what they had done.

While she slept, Shiro attempted to compose a tune to encourage her to forget Basho and their village. But the curse still lingered and the resulting spell greatly weakened both him and Hana.

Hana awoke, confused and with gaps in her memory.

The twins attempted to find shelter from the pouring rain, but the land was flooded once more by the swollen river and constant rains. Too weak to move or hunt, it did not take long for Death to claim the two. They departed the world at the same time in an achingly familiar part of the forest.

But Hana’s spirit was still so full of loyalty to those in this world that she lingered. But her brother’s miscast spell meant she no longer knew who to be loyal to. She lost Shiro’s name first, then the name of her town, and then her own name.

Basho’s name lasted the longest, attached to a hunting trophy of his that remained in her possession, fastened round her neck.

It is said that to this day, one may hear the name Basho called upon the wind. The spirit of the Hunter searches for answers, though she has long since lost her questions.

## Winter Hearts

Once, when the world was not too new but humans still were, a wicked winter swept these lands. A nature spirit had been wronged and waited patiently for the humans keeping her trapped to fight amongst themselves. Yuki, the White Witch, seized her chance at the first moment of weakness. Her magic forced life into the lifeless and corpses became her army, named only after whatever grew near their graves.

The most powerful of these creatures were named for Acontite, Hemlock, Pothos, and Wisteria. Each had their own magic in life that was amplified in unlife, and Yuki trusted them with their own new magic and armies to spread her fury farther, faster. Through these four, the Wolf Clan was destroyed, with song-weaving Pothos stealing the most life with a spell that could kill any who so much as heard a few notes. Only two wolves survived the onslaught.

Many wolves came back under the white witch’s control, however. One was named Reed, for she had drowned in the river before Yuki’s rise to power. Reed’s heart was so clear and pure that even Yuki’s magic could not twist it. Though Reed forgot Rin, her living reflection, she remembered what it was to love, and that kept her mind her own. She was among the small army sent to keep the living clans off-balance during their Festival of Light. Her heart stung for Yuki’s predicament, and though she would kill no one, she let her mischievous ways trip up the villagers, one of many stepping stones on the path to the destruction of the Light Stone.

Her mischief and yarnwork caught the eye of Pothos, the most stoic and serious of the generals. Over the course of the festival, Reed played games with colorful yarn, listened to the stories Pothos told to help her fellow undead, and pestered smiles out of the other woman. Her sincerity turned to warmth in the general’s chest, thawing the ice that Yuki had hardened around her heart. 

The melting shards stung Pothos as she realized what she had done under the control of another. She could not undo the hurt she had caused and could not cease following Yuki’s orders. Her mind was not yet hers. So Reed followed the path Pothos had set - she sent villagers to find the story of Pothos in her life, to tell and retell to give the undead her feathers back, reminding her of her Raven Clan life, reminding her of all that she had once loved.

And so little Reed tore Yuki’s sharpest weapon asunder. But still Pothos did not turn her back on Yuki - though she did betray her other generals, leaving the battle of the clans before its close. She met again with Yuki, who withdrew her forces as the clans came to a realization. Truth was flaring out like bright sunlight after a thunderstorm. They learned their beloved Light Stone kept Yuki sealed from her own home, making her pursue desperate measures. They shattered the stone, and Yuki was freed from the curse poisoning her heart. She sent her army back to rest and returned to her mountain, allowing peace to once more fall upon the valley of the clans.

Before returning to their burial sites, Pothos stole away with Reed. The two used the last of Pothos’s magic to survive a trip to the forest Pothos had once called home, and the pair fell to slumber together beneath her favorite shade tree, near the riverside, so they might both remain near the plants each was named for. They returned to peace with their hands pressed tightly together, a soothing melody hummed from Pothos’s throat as Reed twined their wrists with her colorful yarn. None would ever find their burial site, but rainbows often form in that little clearing to this day.
