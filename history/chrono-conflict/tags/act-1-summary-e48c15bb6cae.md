While tending his wounds from a quick Skirmish, Jasper Addlestone the leader of the Resistance, is visited by Eureka, a NuHelix scientist working for the Withered Hand. Eureka informs Jasper that Porphyrion, leader of the Withered Hand, wants to speak with him about the end of the conflict. Jasper refuses to go with Eureka, telling her to have Porphyrion come to him. Eureka warns Jasper that Porphyrion will just send someone else to bring him in, but Jasper ignores this and Eureka leaves.

Some time later, Shana, a member of Keystone International Enterprises (KIE) who acts as an enforcer for the Withered Hand, storms into Jasper’s room in the bunker after quickly handling his guards. After telling Jasper that she is going to bring him in quietly or not, Jasper calls her bluff by claiming she won’t hurt him because of the treaty that says no blood is to be shed in the neutral territories. Shana quickly takes Jasper out with some carefully placed blows and drags Jasper to Porphyrion’s lair.

After Eureka checks to make sure Jasper isn’t bleeding and that the treaty is still in tact, Porphyrion tells Jasper that they have completed and turned on their machine which will reset the timeline. They claim that the fighting will be over in approximately 48 hours. Jasper tries to attack Porphyrion to no effect. Before leaving, Porphyrion turns to Shana and fires her, claiming she has become a liability. After they leave, in a moment of solidarity, Shana logs onto the computer allowing Jasper to put out a call for people to join him and save the timeline. After his message, Jasper offers Shana a place on the Resistance. She hesitates, then relents and chases after Jasper. Eureka informs Porphyrion that they might want to recruit more forces as well. Porphyrion agrees and sends out a message encouraging people to not be afraid of the Withered Hand, and to join them in their grand new vision of Orlandia.
