## Back Story

### Time of Gods

"Damn Hippies!" Came the thunderous voice breaking the silence inside the office. Its source, the NuHelix CEO, sat hunched in his chair, hands clenched and eyes bulging. Anger boiled over and spewed out of him.

"These little radicals are ruining everything..." Despite the volume being lowered, his words still held their burn, the last ounce of his self-control melting away. Did it matter? No one was in the building the late, save for a few janitors. They would keep quiet. They knew not to speak of what went on behind the closed doors of Orlandia's biggest corporation.

The report that sparked his anger still sat right in front of Mr. Metz. His eyes hadn't moved though his body shook furiously.

Despite the company's best attempts, it seemed as though that once again the radicals that lived out in the Wyldes of Orlandia had stopped his plans. This had been going on for too long. There was a short time where it looked like they had finally let up, but it seemed, almost out of nowhere, the radicals had found a source of gems. They financed a large scale protest at one of the larger sites and completely chased off the workers.

Now it was all going downhill. The plans, the company, Orlandia. Mr. Metz was growing both weary and desperate. "I'm sick of this!" He yelled, slamming both fists onto the table. "Sick of these little... cretins." Couldn't they see that the world needed to advance? Saving the Wyldes would only stop progress and surely leave many without jobs, homes and food. All for the sake of the damn animals.

It wasn't as though he'd allow the entirety of every forest die off. He'd save some pieces, some animals, create a place for it all and put it in the new city that they desperately needed. Which would be paid for by the gems and jewels found in the ground beneath all of the untouched land. It would be perfect if it hadn't been for the Wyldewood Preservation Society.

Mr. Metz let out an exasperated sigh and looked up from the desk. The sound had started minutes before, but he had ignored it originally. He believed it to be some noise down the hall or in another room. Now it was much too loud to ignore. It was... pulsing. As if a heart were slowly coming to life in his office. His eyes narrowed, looking closer at what should have been open space.

Right above the carpet, the air warped unnaturally. Mr. Metz stood up slowly, unblinking eyes wide with shock. His anger was forgotten. Now all that was left was a combination of curiosity, fear, and confusion. "What in the name in Orlandia...?" He whispered, pulling himself up fully from his chair.

Somehow, in some way, the warped air was making the pulsing noise.

Mr. Metz stood behind his desk, gazing forward. He wouldn't approach. Not until he could find out exactly what this thing was. But how would he do that? He was no scientist; he was a business man.

Slowly, his hand reached into his pocket, aiming for his cell phone. Maybe he could reach someone to come quickly and identify this thing. When his hand wrapped around the piece of metal, the warped air let out a loud thump and then a noise like it was breathing in. Mr. Metz froze. Had movement made it... come to life. Did it know what he was trying to do?

It breathed again and then made the same pulsing noise as before, this time much louder. And then it fractured.
