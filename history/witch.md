Orlandia at Anime Festival Orlando (AFO) 2015 dealt with the history of the conflicts and introduced a new group of characters fighting for control of a valley. There was a new card game and two new factions fighting against a third group, the Withered Hand. Players involved in the card game and other activities in the Tavern helped decide which faction would take control of Orlandia at the end of the weekend.
