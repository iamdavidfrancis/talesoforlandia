## The Factions

### The Frontier Settlers

Led by Deputy Jude Lawson.

### The Jesters

Lead by The Bandit King

## The Story

High Moon introduces the never-before-seen Western side of the Continent of Orlandia. It's the (weird) Wild West in the town of Khazstone! A total lunar eclipse will soon be happening, and rumored celestial vault at it's climax! This was foretold by a prophecy held tightly by the citizens of Khazstone, currently led by Deputy Jude Lawson (whose father, Sheriff Julian Lawson, had died under mysterious circumstances one week ago). However, the CEO of Keystone Interational Enterprises, Kitrich Ibis Emerson, has heard of this prophecy, and has come to the town to get more information. In addition, with the absence of Sheriff Julian, the Bandit King has rounded up his gang of Jesters to return to the town they had been run out of decades ago by the former sheriff.

> "When the light of the Red Knight and the Dragon Lady align, Orlandia’s shadow will fall upon and reveal the Khazrdanium Moon. During the time of the eclipse, the entrance to a celestial vault will make itself known. To pass the barrier, you must make an offering of Khazrdanium. If you are deemed worthy, you will be protected and allowed to gain the ultimate power laid within."

It's a three way race as the Frontier Settlers, The Jesters, and the KIE all rally their factions to mine up as much Khazrdanium from the nearby mines so that their faction can gain access to the celestial vault!

Will Deputy Jude lead the Frontier Settlers to victory, while also trying to solve the murder of his father?

Will The Bandit King claim the vault, and re-establish his Jesters as a force to be reckoned with in the town of Khazstone?

Will Kitrich build the KIE into an even more powerful force, taking over Khazstone in addition to their presence in the metropolis of Keystone?

## Act Summaries

### Act 1

Deputy Jude paces alone in the sheriff’s office in Khazstone. He is interrupted by a surprise visit from Kitrich Ibis Emerson, the CEO of Keystone International Enterprises (or the KIE). He congratulates Jude on his upcoming promotion and once again extends his condolences about the death of Jude’s father, the former sheriff. Kitrich claims to have come to town to ensure the train he has built between the towns of Keystone and Khazstone is working properly, and that he is here to view the upcoming eclipse.

Deputy Jude is surprised and inquires how Kitrich knows about the eclipse. Kitrich deflects by bringing up the other significant event plaguing Khazstone…the return of The Bandit King and his Jesters. Deputy Jude assures Kitrich that he intends to run them out of town, just like his father before him, when The Bandit King himself enters the office. After taunting the deputy, The Bandit King again inquires as to why Kitrich has come to town.

Kitrich reveals that he knows about the prophecy the Frontier Settlers have and that it concerns a vault; a fact that quickly interests The Bandit King. Deputy Jude at first denies any knowledge he and the other Frontiers Settler might have about such a prophecy, but after Kitrich threatens the townsfolk, Deputy Jude relents and reads the prophecy.

The prophecy regards The Khazradanium Moon, a rare celestial event when Orlandia’s two suns cast Orlandia’s shadow onto the moon in a superlunar eclipse. When this happens, the entrance to a celestial vault will be revealed. If an appropriate offering of Khazradanium is made, the one making the offering will be protected and allowed to access the ultimate power within the vault.

After reading the prophecy, The Bandit King and Kitrich make a hasty exit to begin gathering khazradanium ahead of the eclipse, leaving Deputy Jude alone again with the work ahead of him.

### Act 2

Kitrich stands alone in the back room of the saloon, impatiently checking a pocket watch. Deputy Jude arrives and cautiously surveys the room as Kitrich invites him to sit. Kitrich suggests they get started, as he doesn’t know when or if The Bandit King will show…just as The Bandit King arrives. With all three leaders present, Kitrich explains why he has gathered them. Kitritch believes that the back and forth they have been doing is tedious and pointless, given that they don’t know how much khazradanium will be required for the offering. He produces a contract and prepares to offer the leaders a deal for a ceasefire and their full cooperation in securing what is in the vault for the KIE. For Deputy Jude and the Frontier Settlers, Kitrich offers a full withdrawal of the KIE from the town of Khazstone. They will cease all their operations within the town borders and the surrounding mines, aside from leaving the train to Keystone available and running. For The Bandit King and the Jesters, Kitrich offers them a full pardon for their crimes. Both men express doubt, but Kitrich assures each of them and encourages them to sign. There is a long pause as the men consider the deal presented to them. But after a moment, The Bandit King speaks up. He points out that Kitrich has been hiding a vital piece of information from them; a fact that Kitrich dismisses. The Bandit King turns his attention to Deputy Jude and, through a series of questions, leads him to the realization that Kitrich was responsible for the death of Deputy Jude’s father. Outraged, Deputy Jude rips up the contract and storms out. Kitrich expresses his disappointment, but The Bandit King assures him that he knew that Kitrich was never actually going to fulfill the promises in the contract. Kitrich exits, leaving The Bandit King alone, laughing at the frustration he has caused Kitrich.

### Act 3

The Bandit King, Kitrich, and Deputy Jude all arrive at the location of the entrance to the celestial vault as the eclipse begins. Drawing guns on each other, the three enter an uneasy showdown. Deputy Jude suggests that it might be better if none of them has what’s in the vault rather than any one of them. As the eclipse begins to fade, Kitrich breaks the line and makes a dash for the vault. Shots are fired from all sides and Kitrich is shot and killed. Deputy Jude is injured in the gunfight and runs off to seek medical attention. The Bandit King is left alone and passes through the barrier into the vault. The lights go out around them as he witnesses what is inside the vault and begins to laugh in horror before the lights are cut and his fate is left unknown.
